```{r}
HIV_data = read_csv("./data/DOHMH_HIV_AIDS_Annual_report.csv")
```

cleaning the dataset for additonal analysis...
```{r}
hiv = HIV_data %>% 
               janitor::clean_names()%>%
               filter(uhf != "All")%>%
               filter(borough != "All")%>%
               filter(gender != "All")%>%
               filter(age != "All")
```

Are there differences in HIV diagnosis rate between boroughs?
```{r}
  fit = lm(hiv_diagnosis_rate ~ borough, data = hiv)
summary(fit)
summary(fit)$coef
```
