## Prevalence by borough

Making of spaghetti plot showing persons diagnosed HIV infection by borough over
the years.
```{r}
 borough_prevalence = hiv_data %>%

    filter(uhf =="All") %>%
   filter(race == "All") %>%
   filter(gender == "All") %>%
   filter(!borough == "All") %>%
  group_by(year, borough)

borough_prevalence %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = plwdhi_prevalence, color = borough)) + 
  geom_line() 
```
