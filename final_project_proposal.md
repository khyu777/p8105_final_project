Motivation
----------

This project is motivated by Governor Cuomo’s initiative for ending the AIDS epidemic in New York State by 2020 (ETE 2020). In line with the plan’s goals, we aim to identify key vulnerable populations in New York City (NYC) disproportionately burdened by HIV/AIDS in order to improve interventions implemented under this initiative. To that end, we plan to utilize annual HIV/AIDS reports from NYC through the NYC Open Data database, as well as supplementary NYC geographic information. Our analyses will focus on exploring potential health disparities across geographic and sociodemographic variables. Understanding the current trends for HIV/AIDS across time and in relation to comorbidities will be another relevant focus of our investigation in order to understand the current state and effectiveness of HIV/AIDS interventions in NYC.

Intended final products
-----------------------

The intended final products for this project includes a website depicting our group’s main research question as well as answers to our secondary questions. Additionally, we plan to include the process that was undertaken to address these questions in addition to any exploratory data analyses that were used. Our findings will illustrate any observed trends as well as possibly identify any aims for HIV/AIDS interventions within NYC as part of the NY state initiative.

The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

-   Distribution of new HIV diagnoses over time
-   Distribution of new HIV diagnoses across sociodemographic variables
-   HIV prevalence by neighborhood tabulation areas within NYC
-   Are there variations in comorbidity rates (concurrent diagnoses) based on NYC Neighborhood Tabulation areas?

The anticipated data sources
----------------------------

-   NYC Open Data: NYC HIV/AIDS Annual Report
-   UHF map

The planned timeline
--------------------

-   November 12-16: Project Review
-   By November 20: Cleaning + Data wrangling
-   By November 28: EDA + Visualization
-   By December 5: Deciding on report-worthy findings + Building the webpage
-   December 6: Final report, webpage, and screencast
