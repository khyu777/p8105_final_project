### Exploratory Data Analysis of death rate outcome variables for HIV/AIDS in NYC

Loading libraries:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)

theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

Loading the data:

```{r}
hiv_data = read_csv("./data/DOHMH_HIV_AIDS_Annual_Report.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

Cleaning the data to just look at times, controlling for gender, age, race, borough, and UHF:

```{r}
hiv_year_data = hiv_data %>% 
  filter(
    borough == "All",
    uhf == "All",
    gender == "All",
    age == "All",
    race == "All"
  )
```

Looking at death rates across time:

```{r}
ggplot(hiv_year_data, aes(x = year, y = death_rate)) +   
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Death rates over the years",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Death Rate"
  )
```

Mapping all outcome variables on the same graph.

First gathering several outcome variables of interest into one outcome variable:

```{r}
all_death_rates = hiv_year_data %>% 
  gather(key = death_rate_type, value = death_rate_nums, death_rate:non_hiv_related_death_rate) %>% 
  filter(death_rate_nums != 99999)

ggplot(all_death_rates, aes(x = year, y = death_rate_nums, group = death_rate_type)) +   
  geom_line(aes(color = death_rate_type)) +
  labs(
    title = "Death rates types over the years",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Rate"
  )
```

Making a stacked bar graph instead of a spaghetti plot - this is probably more informative than the spaghetti plot.

```{r}
stacked_death_plot = all_death_rates %>% 
  filter(death_rate_type != "death_rate")

ggplot(stacked_death_plot, aes(x = year, y = death_rate_nums, group = death_rate_type)) +   
  geom_col(aes(fill = death_rate_type)) +
  labs(
    title = "Death rates types over the years",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Rate"
  )
```

### Percent viral suppression EDA (over time)

```{r}
ggplot(hiv_year_data, aes(x = year, y = percent_viral_suppression)) +   
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Percent viral suppression over the years",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Percent viral suppression"
  )
```

Split by age:

```{r}
split_by_age = hiv_data %>% 
  filter(
    borough == "All",
    uhf == "All",
    gender == "All",
    race == "All"
  )
  
ggplot(hiv_data, aes(x = year, y = percent_viral_suppression, group = age)) +   
  geom_line(aes(color = age)) +
  labs(
    title = "Percent viral suppression by age over the years",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Percent Viral Suppression"
  )
```
