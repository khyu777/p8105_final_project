### Exploratory Data Analysis of death rate outcome variables for HIV/AIDS in NYC

Loading libraries:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)

theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

Loading the data:

```{r}
hiv_data = read_csv("./data/DOHMH_HIV_AIDS_Annual_Report.csv")
```

Cleaning the data to just look at times, controlling for gender, age, race, borough, and UHF:

```{r}
hiv_data = hiv_data %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(
    borough == "All",
    uhf == "All",
    gender == "All",
    age == "All",
    race == "All"
  )
```

Looking at death rates across time:

```{r}
death_rates = hiv_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = death_rate)) +   
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Death rates in HIV over the years",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Death Rate"
  )
```
